# Work Day Scheduler: Intro to Third-Party API'S
## About
This Project was enjoyable, using Moment.js makes working with time a breeze. I learned alot about Third party API's and how they can greatly benifit the users experience. To increase the difficulty of the project i decided to create roughly the entire project using javascript. Making the process of scalability much easier and less tedious. Also, added a save to local storage feature that saves input data when clicking the save button, then changes to a delete button which removes the specific data linked to that element. The following list consists of; newly learned syntax:
- Moment()
- local.storage
- createElement
- appendChild

Looking forward to applying these skill into deeper and more clomplex applications. 5 Star Project, would recommend for beginners in JavaScript!
